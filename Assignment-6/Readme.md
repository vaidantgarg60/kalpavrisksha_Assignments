Virtual File System (VFS) - Assignment & Explanation
Problem Statement

You are tasked with building a Virtual File System (VFS) that simulates an in-memory file
storage environment. The system should allow users to create, read, write, and manage files
and directories using circular and doubly linked lists as the core data structures. The
purpose is to simulate how an actual file system manages memory, directory structures, and
disk block allocations.

Core Initialization and Design Overview

At program startup, the virtual disk and root directory must be initialized. The virtual disk
is represented as a two-dimensional byte array, while the free blocks are organized in a
doubly linked list for easy allocation and deallocation. The root directory '/' is created
during initialization and serves as the starting point of the filesystem hierarchy.

Free Block Management

The virtual disk is divided into fixed-size blocks (e.g., 512 bytes). Each block represents a
unit of storage, and all unallocated blocks are maintained in a doubly linked list of
FreeBlock nodes.
When the system starts, all blocks are free and inserted into the free block list. Each
FreeBlock node contains an index (indicating its position in the disk array) and next/prev
pointers.
• When a file is written: required number of blocks are removed from the head of the free
list.
• When a file is deleted: its blocks are reinserted at the tail of the free list.
• When disk is full: file write operations must fail with an appropriate message.

Directory and File Structure

Each directory and file is represented by a FileNode structure. Directories maintain a
circular linked list of their child entries, which may include files or other subdirectories.
Files, on the other hand, use blockPointers[] to reference actual disk blocks used to store
their content.
Directories do not consume disk blocks. They exist purely in memory as linked lists. Files
consume disk space based on their data size, calculated as (contentSize / BLOCK_SIZE).

Current Working Directory (CWD)

The current working directory (cwd) pointer indicates where the user currently is in the
filesystem. At startup, cwd points to the root directory ('/'). When mkdir or create is
executed, the new node is added to the circular list of cwd. The cwd only changes when the
user executes a cd command.
• On startup → cwd = '/'
• mkdir folder1 → cwd still '/'
• cd folder1 → cwd = '/folder1'
• create notes.txt → file created under '/folder1', cwd unchanged
• cd .. → cwd moves to parent directory

Operation Explanations

mkdir: Creates a new directory under the current directory. Inserts a new node into the
circular linked list.
create: Creates a new file node under the current directory. Initially has zero allocated
blocks.
write: Allocates one or more blocks from the free list, writes content, updates file
blockPointers[].
read: Reads file content by traversing the blockPointers[] array and printing data from
virtualDisk[].
delete: Deletes a file, removes it from directory’s circular list, and returns its blocks to the
free list.
rmdir: Removes an empty directory. Fails if it still contains files or subdirectories.
ls: Lists all entries (files and directories) under the current directory by traversing its
circular list.
cd: Changes the current working directory by updating the cwd pointer.
pwd: Displays the current directory path by traversing parent pointers up to root.
df: Displays disk usage (total blocks, used blocks, free blocks).
exit: Releases all memory, clears linked lists, and terminates the program

Linked List Behavior

1. When inserting a FileNode:
- If the list is empty, the new node points to itself (circular behavior).
- Otherwise, the node is inserted at the end, maintaining circular linkage.
2. When deleting a FileNode:
- Neighbor pointers are adjusted to bypass the node.
- If it was the only node, the list becomes empty.
3. When removing a FreeBlock:
- The head block is removed and reassigned to a file.
- The new head becomes the next node in the list.
4. When freeing a block:
- A new FreeBlock node is appended at the tail of the list.

Constraints

• BLOCK_SIZE = 512 bytes
• 1 ≤ NUM_BLOCKS ≤ 5000
• File and directory names ≤ 50 characters
• Commands are case-sensitive
• Directories must be empty before deletion

Test Cases

/ > mkdir docs — Creates directory 'docs' under root. cwd = '/'. Verifies insertion in circular
list.
/ > cd docs — Updates cwd to '/docs'.
/docs > create notes.txt — Creates file under cwd. No blocks allocated yet.
/docs > write notes.txt 'Hello' — Allocates 1 block from free list, updates file’s
blockPointers.
/docs > read notes.txt — Reads and prints content from allocated blocks.
/docs > delete notes.txt — Removes file node and returns its blocks to free list.
/ > rmdir docs — Removes empty directory 'docs'.
/ > df — Displays total, used, and free blocks.
/ > exit — Frees all nodes and gracefully exits.
